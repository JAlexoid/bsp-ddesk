Java

	You will need to install Java version 1.6 to run this application

Prepare from source
	For source distribution you will need:
		Apache ANT 1.7, see http://ant.apache.org/manual/index.html for installation instructions
		Java SDK 1.6

	Run
	 $>ant dist
	in the distribution/project directory. It will build the application and package it.

Database

	For the database you will need PostgreSQL 8.1 or above with PL/pgSQL language available(it is available by default)
	The database has to be configured to be accessed via TCP/IP.
	See http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/static/index.html for more information

	To setup database you just need to run the ddesk-db.sql against your DB. Create the database with UNICODE encoding, if needed.

	Here are the full steps(PostgreSQL CLI tools have to be accessible):
		Create the database
			$> createdb -E UTF8 ddesk -U youruser -h posgresql.host -p 5432
		Create structure and base data(run this in the DDesk directory)
			$> psql -U youruser -h posgresql.host -p 5432 ddesk < ddesk-db.sql
	The database is ready to be connected to.

Tomcat

	This application has been tested with Tomcat 5.5 and 6.0.

	Unpack the Tomcat distribution. Install as described in http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/setup.html
	If you are going to use Tomcat Manager or Ant build script's auto deploy, then see http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/manager-howto.html#Configuring%20Manager%20Application%20Access


Start application

	DDesk is packaged to have all required information within.

	NOTE: Database configuration is done in /META-INF/context.xml ( Main /web/META-INF/context.xml or Distribution's /dist/ddesk/META-INF/context.xml)
			Please update required values in there.
			This can be done anytime before or after deployment.
			After deployment, the context.xml will reside in [tomcat-intallation]/webapps/ddesk/META-INF/context.xml and [tomcat-intallation]/conf/Catalina/[host]/ddesk.xml
			A redeploy or reload is required.
		Advanced users may want to tinker with the configuration options.

	Deploy manually:
		In the dist directory, there are a ddesk.war and a ddesk directory.
		You may log into Tomcat Manager and install ddesk.war, see http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/manager-howto.html#Deploy%20A%20New%20Application%20Remotely
		If you have direct access to webapps directory, you can copy the ddesk directory to Tomcat's webapps directory. Removing that directory will undeploy the application.
		You can also copy ddesjk.war there to achieve the same effect.
		You can repackage the application by running 'ant package' (Requires ant)

	Deploy out of script(Requires ant):
		Edit the deploy-tomcat.properties file with your access information and Tomcat manager location
		The build script has three deploy commands: deploy, deploy-inplace and deploy-inplace-full.
		Only deploy can deploy DDesk onto nonlocal machine. Inplace deploymet require Tomcat running locally.
